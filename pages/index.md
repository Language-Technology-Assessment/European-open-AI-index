We assess the openness of generative models for [text](/the-index?type=text "Text models in the European Open Source AI Index"), [image](/the-index?type=image "Image models in the European Open Source AI Index"), [code](/the-index?type=code "Code models in the European Open Source AI Index"), [video](/the-index?type=video "Video models in the European Open Source AI Index"), & [audio](/the-index?type=audio "Audio and voice models in the European Open Source AI Index"). Among 'open-source' AI, we find large differences in actual openness.
