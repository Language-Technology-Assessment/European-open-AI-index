# A European Open Source AI Definition

In Europe, everyone developing and deploying open-source generative AI systems has to navigate two issues: strict requirements for privacy protections laws (in form of the GDPR or its derivatives in e.g. the UK or Switzerland) and unclear regulation of open source AI systems (as included in the EU AI act and the Cyersecurity Act). To make things worse, Europe did not even have an own defintion of open source AI that is aligned with its own laws. Nonetheless, organisations in Europe have made significant contributions to the open source AI ecosystem with The Swiss AI Initiative's "Apertus" models a latest example. Here, we recap the current regulatory situations and propose a European Open Source AI defintion that is both GDPR-aligned and super simple. And the best thing about it: it is already used by some of the leading open source AI models of Europe.

### Current definitions and European regulation 

No clear definition linked to the EU AI Act and or GDPR

Only a definition proposed by the Open Source Initiative (Palo Alto, US) that does not mandate all training data to be shared. It has become clear that this approach is not in line with recent developments in Europe, where the GDPR has enshrined each person's [eight core rights](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-3/) in relation to their data.

### A definition fit for Europe

Designed for maximal simplicity _and_ GDPR alignment

Key difference to the Open Source AI Definition 1.0 (proposed by the Open Source Initiative, Palo Alto, US) is 

all training data has to be shared (either by the model providers themselves or by linking to an existing already open source-licensed dataset.
This definition is based on the view that, in AI systems, _data is part of the model_ 


Recent work has shown feasibility and potential of open-source AI. OLMo Trace, Apertus
