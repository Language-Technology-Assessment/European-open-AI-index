## What is the European Open-Source AI index?
The European Open-Source AI Index surveys and evaluates ‘open-source’ generative AI systems based on European Union regulation. 

The index is maintained by [Andreas Liesenfeld](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/liesenfeld-a) and [Mark Dingemanse](https://markdingemanse.net) and affiliated to the [Centre of Language and Speech Technology, Radboud University, The Netherlands](https://www.ru.nl/en/cls/clst). 

## Why is open-source AI important?
Open-source software and systems are a crucial building block of innovative technology ecosystems and provide an important alternative to proprietary, closed systems for users and builders of generative AI systems. True openness fosters innovation that not only serves commercial interests, but also contributes to knowledge access, free education, and a more informed public debate about this emerging technology.

## How is open-source AI regulated in the EU?
In 2025, the AI landscape will be shaken up by the enforcement of the EU AI Act, the world's first comprehensive AI law, with a projected impact comparable to GDPR. This regulation pays special attention to open-source systems and regulates ‘open’ systems differently. But the EU AI Act neither defines openness nor specifies how open-source licenses relate to openness. This work will be carried out by the future EU AI Office.

## What are the risks when the definition of ‘open’ is still open?
The unclear definition of openness in the domain of generative AI creates loopholes for overclaiming openness (by ie. using an open source license for a single aspect) and the risk of unintended claims to exemptions based on open-source status under EU law. A practice known as ‘open-washing’.

## How we evaluate openness
We created an evidence-based framework that distinguishes 14 dimensions of openness, from training datasets to scientific and technical documentation and from licensing to access methods. We published our research in a paper. The data is continuously updated and publicly available via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Language-Technology-Assessment/main-database). **Contributions are encouraged**. The website you’re currently reading is providing a user-friendly interface for the data from the Github repository and gives extra contextual information to a wider audience.

## Why did we do this?
Evidence-based openness assessment can help foster a generative AI landscape in which models can be effectively regulated, model providers can be held accountable, scientists can scrutinise generative AI, and end users can make informed decisions.
