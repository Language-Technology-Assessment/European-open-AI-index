## How to add a model to the Index

The index database is managed via an open [data repository](https://github.com/Language-Technology-Assessment/main-database/tree/preview) hosted on GitHub. We track models to add using Github Issues, and add them to the list using Pull Requests 
(resolving the issues). Before you add an issue, please check whether the model is 
already listed. Before you add a Pull Request, please check whether someone else is already 
working on the issue.

## Contributing Pull Requests

We particularly welcome Pull Requests that address existing issues. If you're looking to contribute, 
a good way is to check the list of open issues and see if you can contribute missing data. 
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Cover all dimensions of openness as described in the [readme](https://github.com/Language-Technology-Assessment/main-database/blob/preview/readme.md) file.
- Document and motivate your choices for degrees of openness by providing links to sources

Thank you for your contribution!


## Updating your Pull Request

A lot of times, making a Pull Request that adheres to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your Pull Request before we merge it. There's no need to open a new Pull Request, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
