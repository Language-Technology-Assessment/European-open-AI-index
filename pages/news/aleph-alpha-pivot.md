# The language model that wasn't

At the European Open Source AI Index we take an interest in large language models that bill themselves as open, so we perked up last year when German AI company Aleph Alpha [described itself](https://aleph-alpha.com/aleph-alpha-raises-a-total-investment-of-more-than-half-a-billion-us-dollars-from-a-consortium-of-industry-leaders-and-new-investors/), in a VC funding round, as "committed to reproducibility, excellence and sharing innovation through open source."

The Aleph Alpha website advertised a language model called "Luminous". We had contemplated adding this model to our own index, but had not been able to locate it! The company website did offer quite some [documentation](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/docs/Deprecated%20Luminous/Deprecated-Luminous/Deprecated-Luminous/) but finding the model itself was proving quite elusive.

Based, presumably, on this same documentation, the Stanford Foundation Model Transparency Index _did_ include Aleph-Alpha's Luminous model, and in fact listed it near the top of its index, where it stayed at least until May 2024:

Aleph-Alpha managed to collect half a billion in that funding round, and the company was much hyped in Europe, where it was widely touted as a home-grown alternative to ChatGPT along the same lines as French-made Mistral. [Positioning itself](https://aleph-alpha.com/aleph-alpha-raises-a-total-investment-of-more-than-half-a-billion-us-dollars-from-a-consortium-of-industry-leaders-and-new-investors/) as a key player in "global AI race", it certainly profited handsomely from the hype and general nervousness of markets surrounding AI offerings.

Today, with untold millions spent on nobody knows what, Aleph-Alpha announces a major pivot away from creating their own models. As founder Jonas Andrulis [told Bloomberg](https://archive.ph/fbUK2), 

> “The world changed. Just having an European LLM is not sufficient as a business model. It doesn’t justify the investment.”

The model details for Luminous are shown as "deprecated". We're left wondering whether Aleph-Alpha actually ever _had_ its own LLM.
