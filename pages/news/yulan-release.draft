# YuLan-Mini - A new highly open model
<date :date="date"></date>

At the European Open Source AI Index, we welcome any efforts to promote openness in the AI space. It is to our delight, then, that we have recently seen a new model climb our index to overtake BLOOMZ for the second-place spot.

YuLan-Mini is a new model by the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence. Claiming particularly good performance in math and code, the model is fully open according to nearly all of our [openness measures](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3630106.3659005). The model creators publish the data used to train their base model on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yulan-team/YuLan-Mini-Datasets), providing thorough information on the mixture through use of an [accompanying table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YP8-loVUxgxo36UEpOwflR3GRHLieBnLlCy8g10g8RU/edit?gid=0#gid=0). The model weights themselves are published under an [open MIT license](https://huggingface.co/yulan-team/YuLan-Mini-Instruct), and training procedures and code are published both on [GitHub](https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Mini/) and in a [corresponding paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17743). Lastly the model itself is made availabe through [Ollama](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17743) for convenient use.

We commend the effort involved with open-sourcing this model to such a significant extent. Unfortunately, it seems that the model has thusfar received relatively little attention from the open-source community. With all versions of the model currently sitting at less than [150 downloads per month](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/YuLan-Mini-GGUF), we would encourage existing parties in the open-source space to seek out the model and adopt it for their own purposes.
