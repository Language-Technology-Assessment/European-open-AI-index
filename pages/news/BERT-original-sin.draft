# BERT: The original sin of open-washing large language models


In late 2018, before large language models (LLMs) became mainstream, Google released a large language model bound to shake up the natural language processing (NLP) research community. 
The model dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for many benchmarks in the field, trailblazing the upcoming explosion of interest in LLMs. 
The community was awe-struck by what this model could do and celebrated the new "transformer" machine learning architecture it was build on.
The model even spawned a new scientific field dedicated to the study of it, [BERTology](https://aclanthology.org/2020.tacl-1.54/). 
Amidst the buzz, few thought about asking what data BERT was trained on or whether is was really "open source" as [Google claimed on their website](https://research.google/blog/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-the-art-pre-training-for-natural-language-processing/).

Google's BERT continues to shape research in NLP to this day. The paper that introduced BERT became the most cited scientific publication in the field of NLP with over 125.000 citations on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)). 
A host of popular spin-off models were on top of BERT, introducing a wide range of models for specific applications such as BioBERT, SciBERT, FinBERT or RoBERTa. In short, with the help of BERT, Google shaped the course of an entire scientific discipline for years to come. Here's why this still matters today. 
We still don't know exactly how BERT was built. Dazzled by it's technological marvels, even the scientists that introduced the field of BERTology that examines what BERT can do, did not show interest to ask how it was built and don't mention "training data" in [their work](https://aclanthology.org/2020.tacl-1.54/). 

As the first LLM that was highly influential in science despite deliberate nondisclosure of it's training data, **BERT was the original sin of open-washing that lead an entire scientific community down a dubious path**. As a publisher, Google actively marketed the model as open-source without providing sufficient information how it was built. 
And as a dazzled audience, the research community failed to call out the adverse effects on a lack of transparency for too long. BERT should be remembered both a milestone in the history of NLP and the first testament of open-washing in the field of generative AI.

"When talking about Open Source AI, the same set of issues arose over and over again, when discussing training data: What about Data Protection and Privacy? What do we do about different artistic works having different licences depending on the country? What happens if an Open Source AI model discovers one of the images in its training data is copyrighted and cannot be redistributed? How can we ensure legal certainty when all it would take was for a single copyrighted image to be accidentally included in a dataset, to render all AI models using that dataset proprietary (with massive consequences for what they then have to do to comply with the EUâ€™s AI act)?

These are real and genuine concerns, which the FSF has also identified in its work on Open Source AI. SFC has also identified these issues, saying that it may take a decade to come up with a definition."

Open-washing in as old as LLMs are.
