# BERT: The original sin of open-washing large language models


In late 2018, before large language models (LLMs) became mainstream, Google released a large language model bound to shake up the natural language processing (NLP) research community. 
The model dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for many benchmarks in the field, trailblazing the upcoming explosion of interest in LLMs. 
The community was awe-struck by what this model could do and celebrated the new "transformer" machine learning architecture it was build on.
The model even spawned a new scientific field dedicated to the study of it, [BERTology](https://aclanthology.org/2020.tacl-1.54/). 
Amidst the buzz, few thought about asking what data BERT was trained on or whether is was really "open source" as [Google claimed on their website](https://research.google/blog/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-the-art-pre-training-for-natural-language-processing/).

Google's BERT continues to shape research in NLP to this day. The paper that introduced BERT became the most cited scientific publication in the field of NLP with over 125.000 citations on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)). 
A host of popular spin-off models were on top of BERT, introducing a wide range of models for specific applications such as BioBERT, SciBERT, FinBERT or RoBERTa. In short, with the help of BERT, Google shaped the course of an entire scientific discipline for years to come. Here's why this still matters today. 
We still don't know exactly how BERT was built. Dazzled by it's technological marvels, even the scientists that introduced the field of BERTology that examines what BERT can do, did not show interest to ask how it was built and don't mention "training data" in [their work](https://aclanthology.org/2020.tacl-1.54/). 

As the first LLM that was highly influential in science despite deliberate nondisclosure of it's training data, **BERT was the original sin of open-washing that lead an entire scientific community down a dubious path**. As a publisher, Google actively marketed the model as open-source without providing sufficient information how it was built. 
And as a dazzled audience, the research community failed to call out the adverse effects on a lack of transparency for too long. BERT should be remembered both a milestone in the history of NLP as well as the first testament of the adverse effects of overclaiming transparency in the field of generative AI. Open-washing in as old as LLMs are.
