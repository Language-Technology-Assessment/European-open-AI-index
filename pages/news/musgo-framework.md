# MusGO: A New Companion to Our Framework

We are thrilled to see [Opening Up ChatGPT](https://opening-up-chatgpt.github.io), which served as the precursor to the OSAI Index, cited and expanded in a new direction in [MUSGO: A Community-Driven Framework for Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03599). Inspired by our framework for analysing the openness of large language models, their work proposes a tailored version for music-generative systems. This marks a significant milestone in benchmarking openness, and we are excited to see these ideas being extended into the music domain.

In response, we have expanded the OSAI Indexâ€™s coverage of audio models and will continue to grow our efforts in this space, thanks to meaningful contributions like those of the MUSGO researchers.

A valuable aspect of their work is the MIR (Music Information Retrieval) community survey which highlights how practitioners weigh openness attributes differently. For example, open code, model weights, and documentation were considered more essential than API access or packaging. This aligns with our ongoing exploration into how openness criteria might be weighted differently across domains.

MusGO is a strong example of research collaboration in action, and a welcome contribution to the growing conversation around openness in generative AI.
