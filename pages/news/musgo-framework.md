# MusGO: a new openness index for the music domain

We are pleased to see [Opening Up ChatGPT](https://opening-up-chatgpt.github.io), which served as the precursor to the OSAI Index, cited and expanded in [MUSGO: A Community-Driven Framework for Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03599). Inspired by our framework for analysing the openness of large language models, their work surveys a range of music-generative systems. We are excited to see the general framework being extended into the music domain.

The original framework was introduced precisely to allow these kinds of extensions: "because of its openness, the framework doubles as a possible infrastructure for auditing and a public service to foster AI literacy" ([source](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3630106.3659005)). We are pleased to see this realised in the MUSGO framework, which incorporates the key scientific contributions of the original and is built directly on its codebase while adding a number of useful revisions. Openness breeds openness: building on the MUSGO efforts has enabled us to expand the OSAI Indexâ€™s coverage of [audio models](/the-index?type=audio).

A valuable aspect of the MUSGO work is their survey of the Music Information Retrieval community which highlights how practitioners weigh a range of openness attributes. For example, open code, model weights, and documentation were considered more essential than API access or packaging. This aligns with our ongoing exploration into how openness criteria might be weighted differently across domains.

MusGO is a strong example of research collaboration in action, and a welcome contribution to the growing conversation around openness in generative AI. We encourage you to check out the [MUSGO leaderboard](https://roserbatlleroca.github.io/MusGO_framework/index.html).
