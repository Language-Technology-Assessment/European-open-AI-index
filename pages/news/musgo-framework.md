# MusGO: a new openness index for the music domain

We are pleased to see [Opening Up ChatGPT](https://opening-up-chatgpt.github.io), which served as the precursor to the OSAI Index, cited and expanded in [MusGO: A Community-Driven Framework for Assessing Openness in Music-Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03599). Inspired by our framework for analysing the openness of large language models, this work by Roser Batlle-Roca and colleagues of the [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg) surveys openness and transparancy in a range of music-generative systems.

A valuable aspect of the MusGO study is their survey of the Music Information Retrieval community which highlights how practitioners weigh a range of openness attributes. For example, open code, model weights, and documentation were considered more essential than API access or packaging, leading the team to make a division between 'essential' and 'desirable' openness features. This aligns with our ongoing exploration into how openness criteria might be weighted differently across domains.

MusGO is a strong example of research collaboration in action, and a welcome contribution to the growing conversation around openness in generative AI. Our original framework was introduced precisely to allow these kinds of extensions: "because of its openness, the framework doubles as a possible infrastructure for auditing and a public service to foster AI literacy" ([source](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3630106.3659005)). Meanwhile, openness breeds openness: building on the MUSGO efforts has enabled us to double the OSAI Index’s coverage of [audio models](/the-index?type=audio).
