# The language model that wasn't

At the European Open Source AI Index we take an interest in large language models that bill themselves as open, so we perked up last year when German AI company Aleph Alpha [described itself](https://aleph-alpha.com/aleph-alpha-raises-a-total-investment-of-more-than-half-a-billion-us-dollars-from-a-consortium-of-industry-leaders-and-new-investors/), in a VC funding round, as "committed to reproducibility, excellence and sharing innovation through open source."

In the same period, an entry for their model showed up near the top of the Stanford Foundation Model Transparency Index, and stayed there at least until May 2024.
