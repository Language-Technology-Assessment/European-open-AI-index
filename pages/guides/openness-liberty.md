# On the benefits of open-source AI: open-source enables academic liberty
<author :author="author"></author>

## Introduction
In this second post, we discuss how releasing models in an open-way can benefit academic liberty. We do this by discussing the converse, how (partially) closed models can hurt academic liberty, and subsequently discussing how open-source AI circumvents these flaws.

## Practical example: OpenAI's Codex

## How open models resolve this
- Open-source models require being able to keep and distribute a local copy at all times. This enables academics to distribute their own copies of the models used in their research, ensuring reproducibility is maintained.
- (Aside: What implications are there for this wrt publishing research evaluating AI as a whole through the investigation of closed-source models? E.g. using the GPT-4 API to investigate model agreeability.)
