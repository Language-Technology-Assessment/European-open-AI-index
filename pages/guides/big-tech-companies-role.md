# The role of Big Tech in open-source AI

## Introduction
Both the AI race in general has been largely led by companies which broadly fall under the umbrella of 'Big Tech'. In this blog post, we discuss the historical influence of big tech on AI, as well as ways in which the influence of Big Tech can currently be felt in the open-source AI space in particular. We argue that although the role of Big Tech remains major in the closed-source space, in the open-source space major corporations can best be seen as merely 'contributors' along with e.g. academic institutions.

Out of the five most-liked open-weights LLMs on HuggingFace (DeepSeek-R1, Llama, Bloom, Mixtral, and Phi), only two are by big-tech companies. The others have been contributed by start-ups (DeepSeek and Mistral) and academic bodies. Given the international nature of Bloom, and the Chinese respectively European origins of DeepSeek and Mixtral, it also provides preliminary indications that the American lead on AI models might not be as large in the open-source AI space as elsewhere.

To further investigate these indications, we perform a classification of each open-source model in our index by:
1. Academic or non-academic origins
2. Big-tech dominance (Chinese or American)
3. Country of origin.

The results can be seen in the following pie charts:

From this, we see that academia still plays a major role in open-source AI, contributing nearly a third of the models currently in our index. This indicates that open progress on AI models is currently propelled forward by a combination of academic and non-academic institutions. Further, though Big Tech contributes significantly to open-source AI (with Chinese and American Big Tech together contributing more than a quarter of all models), they are far from the only players. 

We see that, indeed, America and China remain dominant in the AI space. American models span nearly 40% of all models in the index, while Chinese models span more than 30%. However, there is also a significant effort towards international collaborations, and European models together contribute a not-insignificant 12.5% of models. As such, while the two major players in the AI space are indeed dominant, there remain sustantial avenues for nations outside the US and China (and Europe in particular) to participate.

When we restrict ourselves to only looking at the latest AI models (i.e. those with [a 'latest' performance class](https://osai-index.eu/news/performance-classes)), we see a somewhat more restricted picture. Big Tech does seem dominant in the field of the most performant open-source AI models, and non-academic research significantly outcompetes academic research. Further, we see a significant decrease in the diversity of the national origins of models. This indicates that, though the general open-source AI space can be characterized as a collaboration between a diverse number of academic and non-academic entities from various backgrounds, the cutting-edge of this space is by-and-large still dominated by a small group of Chinese and American big tech companies.

## Conclusion
- We seek to have provided a broad overview of the current role of Big Tech in OSAI.
- We found that although the general open-source AI space can be characterized by diversity and a collaboration between academic and non-academic institutions, the cutting edge is by and large dominated by a small number of traditional Big Tech companies.
