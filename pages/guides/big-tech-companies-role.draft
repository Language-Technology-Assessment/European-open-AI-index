## Introduction
Both the AI race in general and the a large early push for open-source in the AI space have been led by companies which fall under the umbrella of 'Big Tech'. In this blog post, we discuss the historical influence of big tech on AI, as well as ways in which the influence of Big Tech can currently be felt in the AI space. We argue that although the role of Big Tech remains major in the closed-source space, in the open-source space major corporations can best be seen as merely 'contributors' along with e.g. academic institutions.

Out of the five most-liked open-weights LLMs on HuggingFace (DeepSeek-R1, Llama, Bloom, Mixtral, and Phi), only two are by big-tech companies. The others have been contributed by start-ups (DeepSeek and Mistral) and academic bodies. Given the international nature of Bloom, and the Chinese respectively European origins of DeepSeek and Mixtral, it also provides preliminary indications that the American lead on AI models might not be as large in the open-source AI space as elsewhere.

To further investigate these indications, we perform a classification of each open-source model in our index by:
1. Country of origin (if applicable).
2. Originating institution group (American Big Tech, Chinese AI tigers, Start-up, Academia, Individuals).
