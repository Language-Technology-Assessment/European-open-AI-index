# On the benefits of open-source AI: open-source supports novel research
<author :author="author"></author>

## Introduction
In this post, we discuss how open-source supports novel research. We outline the research value inherent to publicizing models in a fully open and reproducible manner, and provide examples of the open-source AI community building off earlier work to further academic progress.

## How research value is inherent in open-source AI
- **(Peer-reviewed) papers outlining techniques used**.
- Sharing data collections allowing for insight.
- Publishing training code in a reproducible manner enabling closer scrutiny.
  - Also benefits of publishing checkpoints.
