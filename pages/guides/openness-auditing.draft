# On the benefits of open-source AI: open-source enables oversight
<author :author="author"></author>

## Introduction
In this first of a series of blog posts on the topic of benefits of open-source AI, we explore how open-source AI enables greater oversight. We discuss the theoretical motivations behind the EU AI Act treating open-source models with less harshness, and explore how releasing models in an open-source way would make it easier for watchdogs to investigate legal violations in a model's training.

## How OSAI enables oversight: base principles
