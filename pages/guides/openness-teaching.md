# On the benefits of open-source AI: open-source benefits education
<author :author="author"></author>

## Introduction
In this last post about the benefits of open-source AI, we discuss how open-source AI can further educative goals and enables better training of AI scientists.

## Knowledge of the latest advances is essential for up-to-date learning in a rapidly-evolving field.
In order to obtain expertise in developing the latest LLMs, it is required to for researchers to be aware of the latest advancements. As we discussed in our post on research, this knowledge can best be disseminated through the publication of peer-reviewed papers and thoroughly documented training procedures and data, which is advocated for by open-source. In this way, open-source is a powerful tool not only for the dissemination of knowledge but also for the subsequent learning of said knowledge. The most effective way to keep up with the latest technical AI developments is to simply keep up with the latest-released papers and discuss these, something which is only enabled by the open dissemination of knowledge.

## Truly open models, especially small language models, allow for reproducibility and a hands-on experience with LLMs.
Open-source AI models are a powerful tool for educating the next generation of AI scientists. By having them reproduce language models, especially [small language models](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B), learners obtain an intuitive understanding of how large language models works which is difficult to teach otherwise. This is something we have seen also in the curriculum of our own Radboud University Nijmegen, where transformer-based models are taught through a replication of a small GPT model. By publishing small models in an accessible manner, open-source model creators lower the barrier to hands-on interaction with the latest language models and help in the creation of the next generation of AI scientists.

## Conclusion
Open-source models allow for great opportunities for learning, both for experienced developers and future AI scientists. By futhering open-source in AI, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in AI, and has the opportunity to contribute to its ever-evolving ecosystem.
