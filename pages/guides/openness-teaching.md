# On the benefits of open-source AI: open-source benefits education
<author :author="author"></author>

<!-- Introduction -->
In this last post about the benefits of open-source AI, we discuss how open-source AI can further educational goals and enables better training of AI scientists.

<!-- Knowledge of the latest advances is essential for up-to-date learning in a rapidly-evolving field. -->
As discussed in our post on research, open-source principles encourage the dissemination of knowledge about AI through the publication of peer-reviewed papers and thoroughly documented training procedures and data. It is critical for researchers to stay up-to-date about advances in the field when developing AI models, and open-source encourages this. The simple fact is that the most effective way to keep up with the latest technical AI developments is to simply keep up with and discuss the latest-released papers, something which is only enabled through the open dissemination of knowledge.

<!-- Truly open models, especially small language models, allow for reproducibility and a hands-on experience with LLMs. -->
Open-source AI models are also a powerful tool for training the next generation of AI scientists. Reproducing [small language models](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B) can be a powerful tool for teaching students how language models work. This is something we have seen also in the curriculum of our own Radboud University Nijmegen, where a course on transformer-based models is taught partially through the replication of a small transformer-based language model. By publishing small models in an accessible manner, open-source model creators lower the barrier to hands-on interaction with the latest language models and help in the creation of the next generation of AI scientists.

<!-- Conclusion -->
Open-source models allow for great opportunities for learning, both for experienced developers and future AI scientists. By furthering open-source in AI, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in AI, and has the opportunity to contribute to its ever-evolving ecosystem.

With this series of blog posts, we hope to have provided the reader with a good overview of the various benefits which open-source models provide. The take-away message is that open-source models bring with them a large number of benefits, and publishing models in an open-source manner benefits ecosystem stakeholders in a wide variety ways. Indeed, we hope more entities in the ecosystem this message to heart and release their models in [a fully open way](/the-index).
